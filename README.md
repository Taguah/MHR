# MHR
 Modifications to Monster Hunter: Rise

The mods I write for MHR only require REFramework.
Any lua file here is meant to be placed in the autorun folder of REFramework.
Any config file (likely JSON) is meant to be placed in the data folder of REFramework.

These mods are mostly for myself, so I'll be catering any defaults to my preferences.
